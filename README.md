# Team-Music-Player

**Team-Music-Player** is a collaborative music player that allows team members to add or remove songs from a shared queue, making it easy for everyone to control the music without relying on the person connected to the speaker. Perfect for team environments where multiple people want to control the music in real-time.

## Features

- **Search**: Find songs by name using the YouTube Music API.
- **Queue Management**: Add or remove songs from the queue.
- **Playback**: Play songs from the queue automatically without needing constant requests to the person connected to the speaker.
- **Collaborative**: Team members can control the playlist without interrupting the music.

## How It Works

1. **Search for Songs**: Users can search for songs by name.
2. **Add to Queue**: Once the song is found, users can add it to the shared queue.
3. **Play Songs**: The music plays in the order it is added to the queue.
4. **Auto Play**: When one song ends, the next one in the queue starts automatically.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
